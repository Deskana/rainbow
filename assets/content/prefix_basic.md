Prefix Search API usage
=======

Prefix Search is simply run over page titles, and lets a user find pages that start with ("prefix") a particular term. This is tremendously useful and is where the dropdown box in Wikipedia's user-facing search comes from. It's also exposed via the API, and hits to that service are what we're tracking here.

General trends
------

Prefix Search isn't tremendously used, which makes sense; for external services, the cost of making the call to us is too high to provide seamless dropdowns in the fashion we can on Wikipedia proper.

Outages and inaccuracies

  * None so far!
