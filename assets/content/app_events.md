Mobile App search
=======

User actions that we track around search on the mobile apps generally fall into three categories:

1. The start of a user's search session;
2. The presentation of the user with a results page, and;
3. A user clicking through to an article in the results page.

These three things are tracked via the [EventLogging 'MobileWikiAppSearch' schema](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Schema:MobileWikiAppSearch), and stored to a database. The results are then aggregated and anonymised, and presented on this page. For performance/privacy reasons we randomly sample what we store, so the actual numbers are a vast understatement of how many user actions our servers receive - what's more interesting is how they change over time.

Outages and inaccuracies

* Between 5 May and 6 May 2015, approximately 40% of incoming EventLogging data was lost due to a wider EventLogging outage. You can read more about the outage [here](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Incident_documentation/20150506-EventLogging).
