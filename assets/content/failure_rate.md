Search failure rate
=======

Sometimes, searches "fail" - they don't return a single result. What we're visualising here is the number of queries that failed, along with the number of queries overall.

Failure doesn't actually mean failure for the user, of course: some of these events are from "prefix search" in the search box, where the system attempts to match the user's already-typed characters to an existing page name. Others are from typos, resulted in a search page with no results, but *also* resulted in a spelling correction the user could use to get genuine results.

As we move forward we'll attempt to break this data down in a more granular and detailed fashion.
